# VisualGrounding_Project
Project of the course of Deep Learning on visual grounding

## TASK
Our task was to build, fine-tune and evaluate a deep learning framework that can learn to perform visual grounding on this dataset, in particular 
given one or more descriptions of a certain object contained in an image, it can learn to draw a red rectangular shape around the described object.\
In this project we use:
- **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)
- **YOLO Architecture** 


## DATASET
The visual grounding task in this assignment will employ the **RefCOCOg** dataset, a variant of the
Referring Expression Generation (REG) dataset. The RefCOCOg dataset consists of approximately 25,799
images, each of which contains an average of 3.7 referring expressions.
